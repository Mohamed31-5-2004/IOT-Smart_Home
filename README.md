## 🏠 IoT Smart Home Automation Project

This project is a simulation of a **smart home network** using **Cisco Packet Tracer**, built as part of the Computer Networking course (CSE 261). It demonstrates how IoT devices can be integrated into a home environment to enhance **security**, **efficiency**, and **remote accessibility**.

### 🌟 Objectives
- Automate lighting, appliances, and environmental control
- Monitor the house using webcams and sensors
- Allow the owner to control and access the house remotely using a laptop
- Save energy and time through automation

### 🔧 Tools & Components
- Cisco Packet Tracer (Simulator)
- Central Server (`192.168.0.10`)
- 6 Routers + 6 Switches + Central Switch
- IoT Devices: Webcams, Motion Detectors, Street Lamps, Lights, Fans, ACs, Coffee Maker, Sprinklers, etc.

### 📡 Features Implemented
- VLAN configuration and trunking
- WPA2 Enterprise wireless security
- Centralized server authentication (AAA)
- Remote control of devices via secure sign-in
- Logical division into Kitchen, Bedroom, Living Room, Garage, Garden

### 🛠️ Implementation Steps
1. Network design using routers, switches, and IoT devices
2. VLAN setup and secure wireless networking
3. Server configuration for user authentication and device registration
4. Automation logic (conditions) for each room/device setup

### 🖥️ Project Scope
- **Living Room:** Camera, Motion Detector, Fan, Lamp, Smart Door
- **Bedroom:** AC, Camera, Lamps, Fan, Music Player, Sound Sensor
- **Kitchen:** Coffee Maker, Smoke & Temp Sensors, Camera
- **Garage:** Solar Panel, CO₂ Detector, Humidity Monitor

### ✅ Outcome
A fully simulated smart home system offering **remote access, environmental monitoring, and automation** of household tasks. It aims to demonstrate the power of IoT in making homes smarter, safer, and more energy-efficient.
