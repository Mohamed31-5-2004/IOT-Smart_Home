# IOT-Smart_Home
🏠 IoT Smart Home Automation Project
This project is a simulation of a smart home network using Cisco Packet Tracer, built as part of a Computer Networking course (CSE 261). It demonstrates how IoT devices can be integrated into a home environment to enhance security, efficiency, and remote accessibility.

🎯 Objectives
Automate lighting, appliances, and environmental control

Monitor the house using webcams and sensors

Allow the owner to control and access the house remotely using a laptop

Save energy and time through automation

🔧 Tools & Components

Central Server (192.168.0.10)

6 Routers + 6 Switches + Central Switch

IoT Devices: Webcams, Motion Detectors, Street Lamps, Lights, Fans, ACs, Coffee Maker, Sprinklers, etc.

📡 Features Implemented
VLAN configuration and trunking

WPA2 Enterprise wireless security

Centralized server authentication (AAA)

Remote control of devices via secure sign-in

Logical division into Kitchen, Bedroom, Living Room, Garage, Garden

🛠 Implementation Steps
Network design using routers, switches, and IoT devices

VLAN setup and secure wireless networking

Server configuration for user authentication and device registration

Automation logic (conditions) for each room/device setup

🖥️ Project Scope
